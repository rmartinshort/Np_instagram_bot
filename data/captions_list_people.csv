Did you know that that the National Park Service employs almost 30,000 people?
National park staff are employed to protect, manage and care for the nation's wild spaces.
"A park ranger is a protector. You protect the land from the people, the people from the land, the people from each other, and the people from themselves. It's what you are trained to do without even thinking, a reflexive and unconditional act." - Kurt Caswell
